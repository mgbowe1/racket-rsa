# Racket RSA
This is a racket library to encrypt numbers using rsa. There are also string encoding functions to encrypt messages, but these are still very innefficient, so I recommend writing your own.

# Usage
The constructor takes two prime numbers as arguments. These are the primes used for encryption. The recommended size of these primes is at least 1000 digits.
